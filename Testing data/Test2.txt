Technological advancements have reduced globol poverty significantly in the past 100 yeors Although many people have been able to leave poverty due to this, however, still more than 1 3 bi llion people live in extreme poverty Extreme oc is defined os having less than SI 25 to spend every doy There ore a wide variety of co uses for poverty, which differ per country, but in general causes for poverty include- lack of educotion, environmentol problems, lack of access to bonking facilities, lock of legal ownership of property, lack of rule of law, overpopulotion, epidemic diseases or changing trends in o country's economy.
Economic security includes registration of property ownership, access to banking facilities and a fair and tronsparent rule of law, which includes rules that everyone understonds and respects. Especially in developing countries these three economic securities (property ownership, occess to banking facilities and rule of law) ore often locking. As a result, these countries often hove a lorge informal economy, which results in less respect for ownership or financial and legal rights, moking it expensive to obide by the law.
Informal economies exist in every country of the world, but take up a larger chunk of the gross domestic product (GDP) in developing countries. The informol economy is the part of the economy that is neither toxed or controlled by any form of government. The larger the informal economy, the more insecurity exists far citizens, which can result in unrest and poverty Due to lack of dato, determining the size of the informal economy is difficult. However, Mexico determined in 2014 that the informal economy contributed on overoge 26 percent to their GDP over the decade from 2003 to 2012. That s o large chunk of the economy that is not controlled or monitored and as such affects millions of people.
Unfortunately, economic insecurities ond poverty hove a negotive side effect Many different orgonisations try to help the poor, all with the best intentions. However, these organisations are operating in silos ond eoch of them has their own database with informotion on the citizens they try to help As o result there is no centrolised overview, leaving the person in need without any information or credit history that could be used to improve their situation, while requiring eoch organisation to maintain their own databose. Thus, being poor is often very expensive, resulting in a negative vicious circle and an increose in poverty in already poor countries.
Increased occess to banking, availability of rule of law and respect of property ownership reduces the size of the informol economy Reducing the informal economy has significont advantages including increased government protection for consumers, accumulating government pensions for workers, increosed job security for workers and enobling companies to grow bigger, all contributing to reducing poverty In addition, creating a centralised database for the poor makes being poor a lot less expensive.
Alreody, multiple countries are considering the possibility of adopting Blockchain technology to register and record lond title ownership. Countries such as Sv/eder, Hondu'os and Georgia ore testing Blockchoin technology, although Honduras attempts have recently :tal cd They are developing o land registry that is transparent, enables easy registrotion and respects land ownership. Registering property ownership, such os land titles, on the blockchain has multiple od'-ar'ages such as significantly reducing monual errors, while improving security processes for transferring documents, mortgoge or contracts.
Another area that con drosticolly improve the lives of the poor is Blockchain-enobled remittonces. Today, over $4l0 billion in remittances flow to developing countries, with an average cost of S u pci cert and up to 12 ocrcent in certain regions. Rcmit'onccs ore expensive, opaque and recurring tronsactions of necessity, with the costs borne predominantly by the poor. Blockchain con offer enormous improvements in cost-savings for the poor who send money to fomily in another country Not surprisingly, there are nii.i t pic stoitup: and orgonsaticrs, including the United Nations, who are developing blockchain based remittonce services. A blockchain based remittance service uses a crypto coin to tronsfer money instantly across the globe for a fraction of the costs and uses local agents to exchange the crypto coin into the local fiat money thot con be used by the receiver. Instead of doys and costing o fortune, it takes minutes and is nearly free.
Once multiple charities start collaborating, using the some shared database, it could moke the entire process of helping the poor a lot more efficient, effective and cheaper This would improve the lives of the poor os it gives them an economic profile thot could be used for various other octivities.
The future of poverty should be non-existing, meaning thot as per the UN goo Is, by 2030 poverty is gone in the world Big Dota Analytics, Artificial Intell igence ond Blockchain will enable us to achieve this audacious gool, but only if multiple organisations across the globe ore colloborating.
A few years back when Hadoop was on the rise, many jumped on the Hadoop bandwagon while at the same time having no idea what it was. That created quite a hype and many discovered that a new and disruptive technology is not that easy to implement, especially if you are working in an enterprise environment with IT departments that dont like changes and prefer to stick to their SQL databases, DWH's and cubes.
Larisa, great analysis of how enterprises can get their arms around Big Data and exploit its potential. I do think many Big Data practitioners will have more than one repository - for example, EDWs and Hadoop can serve different use cases, and relevant data cannot always be consolidated in bulk into one place. Enterprises should invest in software that can monitor data usage on EDWs or Hadoop, then move data subsets across platforms to use their infrastructures most efficiently.
  oreiifalkowitz  Couldn't agree more. Big data hides millions of small patterns, each one meaning something Small patterns, on the other hand, provide a specifc.
The numerous digital means of payment that are currently operative in Uruguay are designed to target the general population and particular segments of it to a different extent. They are therefore expected to have a distinct impact on the local and the global economy development. Overall money flows may increase through the use of cards, particularly those that allow differing payments along several time periods while almost all the instruments and policies described generate increases in the number of transactions within the formal economy (diverting them from the informal sector). Many of them further seek to improve social and economic conditions of the poorest households by promoting their financial inclusion and promote the formalisation of MSMEs. Given the high concentration of poor households within specific geographical areas (both neighbourhoods and communities) and the creation of specific retailer network linked to many mobile systems, they should also increase money flows at the local economy level. It is important to acknowledge that the emission of digital means of payment adds direct purchasing power to the market, particularly those that are based on credit, and hence apart from increasing the overall level of economic activity they may also generate significant inflationary pressures.
The concept of 'digital money' encompasses all means of payment that only exist in electronic form - credit and debit cards as well as transfers and payments made through the Internet - online payments - or else by sending a text message from a mobile phone -mobile money (or m-money). The accelerated development of ICT tools has provided with additional varieties of electronic instruments that can be used for an enlarged range of transactions (e.g., pre-paid cards; electronic vouchers), a process that has turned them into most widespread physical money substitutes across the world.
Many of the novel forms of digital money are supplied at a much lower price than that of traditional financial products, a feature that renders them accessible for potential users that self-exclude themselves from the market due to budgetary restrictions. This is particularly so for m-money in the case of individuals from households within the lowest income strata and of micro, small, and medium enterprises - MSMEs - given they would be entitled to get access to the system simply by owning a mobile phone. The low operational costs associated to mobile money systems are also at the root of the economic feasibility of penetrating unattended markets, such as isolated and/or small communities as well as agents that lack any collateral. The ease of operating the system and the consequent decrease in transaction costs act in turn as attractors for other groups of interest, such as young individuals and a share of the elderly (Cassoni and Ramada-Sarasola, 2012 and references therein). Therefore, m-money is considered to outperform other alternative currencies as a vehicle to boost local development and to allow for reducing overall poverty levels through the financial inclusion of vulnerable sub-populations.
The entry of additional actors to financial markets as, e.g., new money issuers (Cernev et al., 2012), and the changes generated in the mechanisms through which money flows within a country (Jack et al., 2010) is in turn expected to rise the money velocity to an extent that depends on the degree of adoption of the alternative currency (Al-Laham. and Al-Tarawneh, 2009).
One notable recent exception is the paper by Ramada-Sarasola (2012), who departs from noting that even though the Kenyan system - known as M-PESA - has increased local trade flows and has partially changed consumption patterns in rural areas, its design, founded on the delocalization of monetary flows, largely prevents to distinguish overall from local effects. The author builds a theoretical rationalisation that suggests that in order to magnify the local impact of digital money, a necessary condition is to combine its introduction with the implementation of local-oriented arrangements ('Alternative Currency Systems' - ACS).
long-lasting success (Moore and McKenna, 1999). The pre-existence of a large network of non-banking agents that may act as intermediaries is essential to reduce infrastructure investment levels. Further, in order not to restrain the participation of non-banking actors in the market, the regulatory and institutional frame of financial activities should be revised prior to the implementation of the system.
Even if the above-stated pre-conditions were granted, an economically feasible system has to overcome at least three additional obstacles that have been denoted by Mas and Ng'weno (2010) as scale, chicken-and-egg-trap, and trust.
The 'chicken-and-egg trap' of attracting both users and stores simultaneously is closely related to the reach of a critical mass of transactions (Mas and Ng'weno, 2010) so that the creation of an attractive outlet network with merchants and other agents, among which financial entities may be included, is of utmost relevance.
for overcoming the resistance to change that characterizes most populations is another dimension that has also been highlighted (Ngugi, Pelowski and Ogembo, 2010). The use of technologies linked to pre-existent structures and social systems is strongly recommended to sort out the latter (Heyer and Mas, 2009).
The expected impact of digital money on inflows, outflows and through-flows would depend on its degree of acceptance among individuals in the target group and also on the degree up to which it would have compensatory and substitution effects. Thus, a key factor determining the likely impacts of the system on the behaviour of its users is the characterisation of the sub-population of interest. Analogously, the actual role that the new currency might play largely depends on the variety of money-substitutes that are already in use among the target population.
In its essence, a credit card is a set of agreements between buyer, seller, issuing bank and credit card label. The buyer agrees to pay at a later date for the products that the seller agrees to deliver today while the issuing bank guarantees that future payment. The credit card label organises all the intermediation, the creation of a large enough network of buyers and sellers and the contracts with all parties. Commercially speaking, it is the seller that gives the credit to the client, as it delivers goods now and will receive payment later. The issuing bank takes the risk over the payments while the credit card label handles the entire process.
However, whenever the balance is fully re-paid in one instalment, free of any extra charge, such additional liquidity would be compensated within a month time. The role of credit cards in this case may be assimilated to that of an alternative means of payment since it enables to make a purchase prior to the effective disposal of an amount of money that will nonetheless be available almost immediately. A further use of credit cards as a substitute of money involves the automatic charge to their balance of monthly and annual expenditures related to home bills and taxes with no cost for the card holder (although a fee is charged to providers, regardless of their private or public character).
Uruguay. However, in November 2007 an upper bound to these rates was established by law in at most 60% over the prevailing average level, as published by the central bank (Law 18.212).
Credit cards also provide an easy and secure means to get access to money at any geographical location. In particular, the international character of credit card labels renders unnecessary for holders to carry large amounts of cash when travelling abroad, even in light of the high cost associated to the service. The relatively low relevance currently assigned to this specific use contrasts however to its being basically the sole attractor for Uruguayan holders in the past, a fact that partially explains the extremely low demand levels observed until the late 1990s.
It was only in 1981 that the first local processing centre emerged as a joint venture of two private national banks (Comercial and La Caja Obrera) that started to handle Visa and shortly after also MasterCard. However, this increased supply was not matched by the demand for credit cards that only involved 2% of the adult population by the mid-1980s most of whom used them just for purchasing abroad.
